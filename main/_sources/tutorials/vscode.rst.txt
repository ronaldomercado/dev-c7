VSCode Integration
==================


VSCode has beautiful integration for developing in containers. See here
https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/remote/containers for a detailed
description of this feature.

When running VSCode with a developer container:

- All integrated terminals run inside the container
- The test explorer will run tests inside the container
- File dialogs will browse the container's file system
- Python and C++ debugging are available for processes running in the
  container


Initial Setup
-------------

Install remote development plugin
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Run up VSCode and install the remote development plugin::

    module load vscode
    code

Then inside VSCode::

    Ctrl+P
    ext install ms-VSCode-remote.VSCode-remote-extensionpack


Update VSCode User settings
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Add the following settings to you user configuration for VSCode in
``$HOME/.config/Code/User/settings.json``

These settings ensures that each terminal loads the bash (login) profile by
default.
Bash will then run .bash_profile and this includes essential setup for
DLS controls developer environment.

.. code-block:: json

    "terminal.integrated.defaultProfile.linux": "bash (login)",
    "terminal.integrated.profiles.linux": {
        "bash (login)": {
            "args": [
                "-l"
            ],
            "path": "bash"
        }
    }

This setting tells remote container development to use podman instead of
docker.

.. code-block:: json

    "remote.containers.dockerPath": "podman"


How to Use
----------

To use VSCode with a developer container, first add the
``.devcontainer`` folder with ``devcontainer.json``
file to the root of your project. The script has a helper to do this::

    c7 -I

or you can create it manually::

    cd <my project folder>
    mkdir .devcontainer
    cd .devcontainer
    wget -q https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dls-controls/dev-c7/main/.devcontainer/devcontainer.json

Then launch VSCode::

    cd <my project folder>
    module load vscode
    code .

Click on ``Reopen in Container`` when you see a dialogue with the message
``Folder contains a Dev Container configuration file.``

Close the first terminal that you see and open another one (see `vscode_known`)

That's it, you are now running a developer container and your vscode session
is connected to it.

The above gets version 2.0.0 which is current as of 01/07/2022.
See https://github.com/dls-controls/dev-c7/releases for the latest updates.


Container Lifetime
------------------

Like the ``c7`` script, the container will be kept alive. If you
exit and re-enter VSCode you will be reconnected to the same container.

When you run ``podman ps`` you will see the container is running and is named
something like this::

    localhost/vsc-dev-c7-914745539fc385a5fe9188693f0fa257-uid

You can recreate the container from scratch by deleting it with ``podman rm``
or you can tell VSCode to rebuild it using the remotes menu. This menu is
accessed by clicking the icon in the very bottom left of the VSCode window.

    :align: center

    The Remotes Menu Button

The remotes menu option ``Rebuild Container`` will close the session,
rebuild the container
and reopen the session in the new container.

Note that this means that the containers used by VSCode and those used
by ``c7`` are distinct. So if you install something into one it will
not be seen in the other.

.. note::

    VSCode will use a different container for each folder. If you would
    like to share a container between folders:

    - open multiple folders in a single VSCode session by choosing "Add
      Folder to Workspace" from the right click menu in the File Explorer
    - choose ``File->Save Workspace As...`` and save the workspace to a
      file, usually in the folder that is a common root to your projects.
    - copy the ``.devcontainer`` folder to the same folder as the workspace
      file.
    - go to the remotes menu (icon in bottom left of VSCode) and choose
      ``Reopen Container``

VSCode Container Removal
------------------------

If you want to remove all of the containers that VSCode has created then the
following will do the trick::

    podman rmi -f $(podman images --filter=reference='*vsc-*' -q)

This may be useful if you are having trouble with VSCode devcontainers or
if you are running low on disk space.

Known Issues
------------

First integrated terminal
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

When a devcontainer is launched, it will usually start a single terminal that is
NOT using the login profile. This means you won't see your usual bash prompt
and none of the DLS development environment will be available.

To work around this, close and reopen the 1st terminal
or type::

    bash -l
