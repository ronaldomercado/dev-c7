Quick Start
===========

Setup
-----

First, if you have never used containers at DLS before, then you must
do an initial podman setup::

    /dls_sw/apps/setup-podman/setup.sh

.. note::

    If you have previously used podman you may need to perform a migration.
    See `../how-to/podman`


Startup Script "c7"
-------------------

Next, copy the startup script to your local bin directory and make it
executable. ::

    cd $HOME/bin
    curl -O https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dls-controls/dev-c7/main/c7
    chmod +x c7

Finally, launch an instance of the container by typing::

    c7

That's it. For further options see `continue`


.. note::
    if don't have a $HOME/bin folder then you will need to do
    ``mkdir $HOME/bin``. It will automatically be added to your PATH in
    any new shells, but the current shell won't see it.

.. note::
    For the first invocation of an updated version of the container there
    will be a 30 second delay while the filesystem user id namespace mapping
    is cached. This will happen after the image is pulled from the registry.

How to Work
-----------

At a dev-c7 prompt you can work normally as if you were sitting at a RHEL7
workstation. Everything should work as before although there are a few
differences, see
`../explanations/differences`.

If you find anything that does not work or have suggestions for improvement,
please report it
`On GitHub Issues <https://github.com/dls-controls/dev-c7/issues>`_.

- You can launch multiple instances of dev-c7 and they will share the
  same container.
- You can run gnome-terminal and open multiple tabs - all will be in the
  container
- You can use module load as usual to make further software from dls_sw
  available
- You can run GUI apps as normal.
- You have full sudo rights and can install anything you need into the
  container with ``yum install``
- Do NOT run vscode inside the container. Instead run it normally and
  feel free to launch dev-c7 inside of its integrated terminals to do
  compilation, testing.


Install edm fonts
-----------------

If you are using edm and the fonts look wrong or you get errors about
missing fonts, then read on. This should not be required for RHEL8 machines
at DLS which should already have the fonts installed.

The edm display manager uses local fonts that need to be installed on your host.

Again, these should be part of the standard RHEL8 installation but early
adopters may need to install them as follows::

    bash <(curl -s https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dls-controls/dev-c7/main/edm-fonts/install-fonts.sh)
